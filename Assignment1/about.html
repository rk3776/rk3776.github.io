  			<p> In the contemporary world, humans have started to reflect upon the invasion of privacy by social media. Two young adults, Robert and Jennifer, are faced to overcome a common problem that arises with social media. There has been an ongoing theory that social media platforms have the ability to hear conversations and through this create algorithms showing advertisements related to the topic of conversations. The couple must overcome the challenge and admit that often social media gets control over what humans think to maintain the relationship they have had for years. </p>
